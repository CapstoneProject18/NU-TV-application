# NU-TV-application
This project helps to reduce the wastage of bandwidth which is assigned for public IP from campus. This will only help to serve encoding of movies and TV series.
It's a taste of private networking along with http server on each host so they their communication over tcp could be thrown to httpServer.

src folder constains some other custom packages. Give a look!!
